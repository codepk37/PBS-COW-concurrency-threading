## xv6 revisited and concurrency

*when will the pain and suffering end?*
Thanks Appa for helping in Report.

## Some pointers/instructions
- main xv6 source code is present inside `initial_xv6/src` directory.
- Feel free to update this directory and add your code from the previous assignment here.
- By now, I believe you are already well aware on how you can check your xv6 implementations. 
- Just to reiterate, make use of the `procdump` function and the `usertests` and `schedulertest` command.
- work inside the `concurrency/` directory for the Concurrency questions (`Cafe Sim` and `Ice Cream Parlor Sim`).

- Answer all the theoretical/analysis-based questions (for PBS scheduler and the concurrency questions) in a single `md `file.
- You may delete these instructions and add your report before submitting.
